# Programming_fun
 In this repo we are exploring fun facts about programming!
 Like in Python why,
                     0.5 + 0.6 == 1.1 ==> True
                     and
                     0.2 + 0.1 == 0.3 ==> False
                     
 so stay in touch we gonna explore much more,
 
 you just need python on your PC, and its good to have jupyter notebook or jupyter Lab, they make this fun more exciting!!
